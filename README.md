# NoteTakingApp
This is an android Note Taking App I have created for MVVM architecture.

I used below diagram as reference which shows a basic form of MVVM architecture.

![mvvm-architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11629459/49515908-3e1c3e80-f8a9-11e8-8360-2a3a4d2e6227.png)

I have walked through on left side (Activity, ViewModel and LiveData, Repository, Model and finally Room).

You can find all MVVM architecture codes for Activity, ViewModel, LiveData, Repository, Model and Room. 

### Application also contains code examples for all requirements below;

- MVVM architecture sample code
- Migration existing app to AndroidX
- How to create room database
- Creating Room database entity class
- Creating Repository to retrieve data from database (best practice)
- Reading data from CSV file and import to room database.
- Creating an adapter for RecyclerView
- Doing database operation on background thread with AsyncTask
- Implementing Parcelable interface
- Passing object between activities.
- Adding Swipe to delete feature to RecyclerView
- Add new object or updating existing one in a activity
- Adding undo operation to onSwiped method via Snackbar action
- Adding DiffUtil to RecyclerView both for better performance and animation
- Creating and naming sub packages for better file structure.
